# growth_rates_from_counts
Code for a paper on growth-rate estimation from sequencing counts.

The figures for exponential, logistic and Gompertz growths with a few variants are generated with 1_Exp_Log_Gomp.ipynb.
The examples with 100 and 1000 variants undergoing logistic growth are generated with 2_Logistic_many.ipynb.
In both cases, the pdf outputs are written in /figs.

Experimental data with 5000 variants, taken from from https://github.com/omghosh/limiting-functions, is analyzed with 3_Exponenital_data.ipynb. The csv data file is in /data. The figures of the analysis are directed to /data/figs.
